### What I learned

I did go overboard on this project. I didn't use the provided svg background waves, instead, I built randomly generated waves using javascript. But other than that, this project is very simple, and the only Javascript needed is the form validation. I've already done a simple email validation from my previous FrontendMentor challenge([Base Apparel coming soon page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0)) so I just copy and paste it.

For the randomly generated waves, this script is heavily inspired from a library: [Wavyfy](https://github.com/peacepostman/wavify) by [peacepostman](https://github.com/peacepostman). And if you wanna try it, I recommend using Wavyfy instead of mine. Wavyfy has a lot more functionality and mine is a little messy

Also, I did consider users who turned off their animation on their device `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. If you do, it will only generate wave once. And if you are not sure if it's turned off, check the console. I leave a `console.log()` to see if it's `ON` or `OFF`.
